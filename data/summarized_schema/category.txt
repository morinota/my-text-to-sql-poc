The "category" table contains information about different movie categories. It includes the following columns:

- **category_id**: This is an integer that serves as the primary key for the table, uniquely identifying each category.
- **name**: This is a string (VARCHAR) that represents the name of the category and cannot be null.
- **last_update**: This is a timestamp that indicates the last time the category information was updated and cannot be null.

Potential use cases of the "category" table include:

- Identifying and listing all movie categories available in a database.
- Tracking changes to category names and update timestamps for auditing purposes.
- Assisting in the categorization and retrieval of films based on their respective categories, which can further support queries related to rentals, sales, or popularity of each category.
- Enabling further analysis on metrics such as the number of films per category or trend analysis over time based on the last update timestamp.
