  "summary": "The \"category\" table contains data related to film categories. It has three columns:\n\n1. **category_id**: An integer that serves as the primary key for the table, uniquely identifying each category.\n2. **name**: A non-nullable string (VARCHAR) representing the name of the category, limited to 25 characters.\n3. **last_update**: A non-nullable timestamp that indicates the last time the category information was updated.\n\nThis table can be used to analyze various aspects of film categories. Potential use cases include:\n\n- Identifying the different categories of films available.\n- Tracking changes to category information over time using the last_update field.\n- Joining with other tables, such as those containing rental or inventory data, to aggregate information related to films within each category. \n\nQuestions that could be answered using this table include:\n\n- What categories of films exist in the database?\n- When was the last update made to each category?\n- How are films distributed across different categories in terms of rental frequencies or average rental durations when combined with rental data."
