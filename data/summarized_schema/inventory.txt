  "summary": "The \"inventory\" table contains data related to the stock of films in different stores. It includes the following columns:\n\n- **inventory_id** (INTEGER, primary key): A unique identifier for each inventory record.\n- **film_id** (INTEGER, foreign key): A reference to a specific film, linking to the \"film\" table.\n- **store_id** (INTEGER, foreign key): A reference to the store where the film is located, linking to the \"store\" table.\n- **last_update** (TIMESTAMP): The timestamp indicating the last update made to the inventory record.\n\nThis table can be used for various analyses, such as tracking which films are available in which stores, understanding inventory turnover rates, and monitoring inventory updates over time. It can also support inventory management processes, help in assessing film availability for rentals, and provide insights into rental patterns by combining data with rental statistics. Questions that can be answered include:\n\n- How many copies of each film are available across different stores?\n- When was the last update made to the inventory for a specific film or store?\n- What is the distribution of films across different store locations? \n\nOverall, the table serves as a foundational dataset for understanding the relationship between films and their availability in participating stores."
