The "inventory" table contains data related to the inventory of films in a store. It has the following columns:

- **inventory_id**: A unique identifier for each inventory item, serving as the primary key.
- **film_id**: A foreign key linking to the films, indicating which film is associated with the inventory item.
- **store_id**: A foreign key linking to the stores, indicating which store holds the inventory item.
- **last_update**: A timestamp indicating the last time the inventory record was updated.

This table can be used to answer questions related to the availability and management of films within various stores. Potential use cases include:

- Tracking the number of inventory items for each film across different stores.
- Analyzing the frequency of updates to inventory for maintenance or auditing purposes.
- Exploring relationships between different films and the stores in which they are available.
- Supporting queries that involve rental activity by linking inventory to rentals through the foreign key relationships involving film and store IDs.

Overall, the "inventory" table serves as a foundational component in managing the stock of films in a rental system, providing vital information that can support various analyses and operational insights.
