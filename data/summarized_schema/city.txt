The "city" table contains data related to cities, with the following columns: 

- **city_id**: a unique identifier for each city (INTEGER, primary key).
- **city**: the name of the city (VARCHAR(50), not nullable).
- **country_id**: a reference to the country the city belongs to (INTEGER, foreign key, not nullable).
- **last_update**: a timestamp indicating the last time the record was updated (TIMESTAMP, not nullable).

This table can be used to answer various questions and perform analyses, such as:

- Identifying which cities belong to a specific country using the `country_id`.
- Tracking updates to city records over time with the `last_update` field.
- Analyzing the distribution of cities within different countries.
- Joining this table with other tables (e.g., country table) to obtain more detailed geographic insights.
- Generating reports on the number of cities in a given country or the most recently updated cities in the dataset.
