The `payment` table contains data related to payments made by customers. It includes the following columns:

- `payment_id`: A unique identifier for each payment, serving as the primary key.
- `customer_id`: An identifier for the customer making the payment, which is a foreign key linked to the `customer` table.
- `staff_id`: An identifier for the staff member processing the payment, which is a foreign key linked to the `staff` table.
- `rental_id`: An identifier for the rental associated with the payment, which is a foreign key linked to the `rental` table. This column may be nullable, indicating that not all payments are tied to a rental.
- `amount`: The total payment amount, stored as a decimal value.
- `payment_date`: The timestamp indicating when the payment was made.
- `last_update`: The timestamp indicating when the payment record was last updated.

Potential use cases for this table include:

- Tracking total payments made by each customer, which can assist in understanding customer spending behavior.
- Analyzing payment trends over time to identify peak payment periods.
- Linking payments to rentals to assess payment patterns related to rental activity, which could inform inventory or staffing decisions.
- Identifying the most valuable customers based on their payment history.
- Monitoring staff performance with respect to payment processing, which could lead to insights on operational efficiency.
