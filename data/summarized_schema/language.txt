The "language" table contains three columns: "language_id," "name," and "last_update." 

- The "language_id" column is an integer that serves as the primary key for identifying each language record uniquely. 
- The "name" column is a character string with a fixed length of 20 characters that represents the name of the language and cannot be null.
- The "last_update" column is a timestamp that indicates when the record was last updated and is also required.

Potential use cases for the "language" table include:
- Identifying and retrieving the names of different languages stored in the database.
- Tracking the last update time for each language, which can be useful for data maintenance and auditing.
- Analyzing the frequency or pattern of updates to the language records over time.
- Joining this table with other tables to associate languages with related entities, such as translations or language usage statistics.
