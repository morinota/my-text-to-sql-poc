  "summary": "The \"language\" table contains data related to various languages. The table includes three columns: \n\n1. **language_id**: An integer that serves as the primary key for the table, uniquely identifying each language record.\n2. **name**: A character field limited to 20 characters that stores the name of the language. This column is not nullable, meaning every entry must contain a name.\n3. **last_update**: A timestamp that indicates when the entry for the language was last updated. This column is also not nullable.\n\nThe table can be utilized to answer questions related to the identification and management of languages. Possible use cases include:\n\n- Determining the number of languages recorded in the system.\n- Tracking changes to language data via the last updated timestamp.\n- Establishing relationships between languages if linked with other tables.\n- Conducting analysis on language usage trends or updates over time. \n\nOverall, this table serves as a structured repository for managing language data, facilitating various analytical and operational tasks."
