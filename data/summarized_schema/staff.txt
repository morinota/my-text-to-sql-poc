The "staff" table contains information about staff members in a business context. It includes the following types of data:

- **Identification and Personal Information**: Each staff member is uniquely identified by a `staff_id`. Personal details include `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email`.
- **Address**: The `address_id` column links to an address table, providing staff address details.
- **Authentication Details**: The table contains `username`, `password`, and potentially a `picture` for user profiles.
- **Store Association**: The `store_id` column connects staff members to specific stores.
- **Activity Status**: The `active` column indicates whether a staff member is currently active, with a default value of 1 (active).
- **Last Update Tracking**: The `last_update` timestamp records the last modification time for the staff member data.

Potential use cases for the "staff" table include:

- Analyzing staff demographics and their distribution across different stores.
- Tracking the activity status of employees for operational purposes.
- Managing authentication and user profile information for staff logins.
- Evaluating staff updates over time through the `last_update` field.
- Generating reports on staff membersâ€™ contact information for communication or organizational needs.
