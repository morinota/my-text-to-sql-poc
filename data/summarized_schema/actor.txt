  "summary": "The \"actor\" table contains data related to actors in a film database. It comprises four columns:\n\n1. **actor_id**: A unique identifier for each actor (INTEGER, primary key).\n2. **first_name**: The first name of the actor (VARCHAR, not nullable).\n3. **last_name**: The last name of the actor (VARCHAR, not nullable).\n4. **last_update**: A timestamp indicating the last time the actor's data was updated (TIMESTAMP, not nullable).\n\nThis table can be utilized to answer various questions, such as identifying actors by their names, tracking how many films each actor has appeared in, and determining the most recently updated information on actors. Potential analyses might include creating lists of actors, grouping actors based on their film appearances, or examining changes in actor data over time."
