  "summary": "The \"country\" table contains data related to countries. It has three columns: \"country_id,\" which is an integer and serves as the primary key; \"country,\" which is a non-nullable string with a maximum length of 50 characters representing the name of the country; and \"last_update,\" which is a timestamp indicating the last time the record was updated.\n\nPotential use cases for this table include:\n\n- Identifying unique countries and their corresponding IDs for various applications.\n- Analyzing changes or updates to country data over time based on the \"last_update\" column.\n- Associating countries with other data entities in a database (e.g., regions, populations, and demographics) using the \"country_id.\"\n- Generating reports that list all countries or specific countries based on certain criteria.\n- Supporting queries that derive insights related to geographical data, such as grouping countries by specific characteristics or statuses."
