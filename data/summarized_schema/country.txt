The "country" table contains information related to countries. It includes the following columns:

- **country_id**: An integer that serves as the primary key for identifying each country uniquely.
- **country**: A string that holds the name of the country, which is a non-nullable field.
- **last_update**: A timestamp indicating when the record was last updated.

Possible use cases for this table include:

- Identifying countries through their unique identifiers.
- Performing queries to retrieve names of countries for reporting or analysis.
- Tracking changes to country records over time with the last_update timestamp.
- Analyzing data related to country-specific metrics alongside other data tables that may reference countries using the country_id. 

This table could answer questions such as "What are the names of all countries in the database?" or "When was the information about a specific country last updated?"
